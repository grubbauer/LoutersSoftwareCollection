[WIP]

This collection of software are simple to use tools.
They are easy to modify and are easy to use. (If you know the mouse-key-binds)
The collection should include:
LoutersDraw
LoutersView
LoutersWatch
LoutersNote
LoutersCode
LoutersAudition

There may be only a few programms, because it's a "Work in Progress".
