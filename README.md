LoutersAudition
===============

LoutersAudition is a lightweight audio player.
It is based on python. It uses the librarys tkinker and pygame.
Since tkinker is already apart of the python standart library, you don't need to install it.
But you need to install pygame with "pip install pygame", since it is a non default library.
